# Price and Peformance in Central Processing Units
Research Project for Statistics and Data Analysis - 358: Linear Regression

The Price and Performance in Central Processing Units repository contains files that pertain to the research conducted on 62 randomly selected CPUs in the past decade.

The PriceVSPerformance.docx/PriceVSPerfomance.pdf are thorough reports and code that go through, step by step, how the research was conducted. The files contain the process of how a linear regression model was obtained through the data.

The Researchproject.pdf is a a general overview of the research conducted in an RMarkdown format. All graphs, tables, basic analyses are conducted and shown in the Markdown file. In addition, provided code is included in this file in case this study was to be conducted again with the same given parameters.

The researchproject_data.csv contains the data used for this research project. This data sheet contains the MSRP of chips, release dates of chips, the benchmark performance of chips, the brand of the chips, the formal name of chips, and the name of the chipset used to create the chip.
